# CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins

This repository contains the source code and configurations for setting up a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins.

## Project Overview
The project demonstrates the following:
- Jenkins setup and configuration
- Building a Docker image for a web application
- Running automated tests
- Deploying to a Kubernetes cluster

## Technologies Used
- Jenkins
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- GitHub

## Pipeline Stages
1. **Checkout Code:** Pull the latest code from the GitHub repository.
2. **Build Docker Image:** Create a Docker image for the application.
3. **Run Tests:** Execute unit and integration tests.
4. **Push to Registry:** Push the Docker image to Docker Hub.
5. **Deploy to Staging:** Deploy the application to a staging environment on Kubernetes.
6. **Deploy to Production:** Deploy the application to the production environment after approval.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ci-cd-pipeline-jenkins.git
   cd ci-cd-pipeline-jenkins

2. **Set Up Jenkins:**
- Install Jenkins on your server or local machine.
- Configure Jenkins with necessary plugins like GitHub Integration, Docker, and Kubernetes plugins.
- Set up Jenkins credentials to access GitHub and Docker Hub.
- Create a new Jenkins pipeline job and configure it to pull the pipeline script from the repository.

3. **Configure GitHub Webhook:**
- Set up a webhook in your GitHub repository to trigger the Jenkins pipeline on code pushes.
- In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings** > **Webhooks** > **Add webhook**.
- Set the Payload URL to your Jenkins server URL followed by `/github-webhook/`.
- Select "Just the push event" or specify the events you want to trigger the webhook.
- Add the webhook and verify that it's working by triggering a test push.

4. **Set Up Kubernetes Cluster:**
- Set up a Kubernetes cluster, either locally using Minikube or Docker Desktop, or on a cloud provider like AWS, GCP, or Azure.
- Configure `kubectl` to connect to your Kubernetes cluster.

5. **Configure Kubernetes Secrets:**
- Create Kubernetes secrets for Docker Hub credentials and any other sensitive data required by your application.
- Apply the secrets to your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl apply -f secret.yaml`.

6. **Update Pipeline Configuration:**
- Update the Jenkinsfile in the repository with your specific configuration, including Docker image name, Kubernetes deployment configuration, and any other pipeline stages or steps.
- Customize the pipeline to match your project structure, testing frameworks, and deployment requirements.

7. **Run the Pipeline:**
- Trigger the Jenkins pipeline manually or wait for the webhook to automatically trigger the pipeline on code pushes.
- Monitor the pipeline execution in the Jenkins UI and ensure that each stage completes successfully.

8. **Monitor Deployments:**
- Monitor the deployments in your Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl` commands or Kubernetes dashboard.
- Verify that the application is deployed correctly and functioning as expected in the staging and production environments.
